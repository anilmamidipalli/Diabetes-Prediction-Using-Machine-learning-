# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning-
This project aims to predict diabetes based on features like Glucose, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We gather and preprocess data, perform EDA, train and evaluate various machine learning models using accuracy_score, select the best one, and deploy it as a Flask web app for user-friendly predictions.
